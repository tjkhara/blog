Wow! I was really down the last couple of days. Got a nasty cold/allergy. That had an effect on my mind also. It was really hard to study, but the great thing is I managed to keep going and kept learning something or the other.

Now I have come back to take some time and learn javascript and some of the front end stuff. I am today going to start again Colt's web dev bootcamp. Never got around to doing it.

Also doing Brad Schiff's JS course and Brad Traversy's JS course. Now appreciating JS as I know some other languages also and can compare them.

My energy is still very limited. Spent the last few days looking over some PHP frameworks as well, but nothing has caught my fancy as of now.

Okay that's it for now.
