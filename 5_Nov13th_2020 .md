Am doing javascript and enjoying it. Found a new method of learning. Watch the video first and then rewatch it and code. I think this helps with retention.

Have been going back and practicing as well. It helps to do multiple courses at once to take a break. Got a nap today. Feeling good. Feel a bit cranky after the nap,
but is better than not taking one.

Watching the peep show and enjoying it.

Two courses I am doing now are the Brad Traversy font end JS course and the Brad Schiff full stack course. I like both and hope I can stick to these and finish them
in a slow and steady manner while retaining a lot of information. JS does seem fun. Maybe let me stick to this till the end of Nov and see how much I can get done.
