Workout - sarted doing hasfit. Feels good. Doing only 10 mins enough to get the body activated, but does not get me tired.

Spoke to Bhakti and family. Zaina was sad when I spoke to her she ran away.

Doing the Andrew Mead course. It is a great course. I am enjoying it.

Enjoying javascript also.

Had that thing with dad where he wanted me to open his stock account, but i was not very happy about it. He changed his mind.
I think that is for the better.
