Bhaji's birthday.

In the morning did the react docker course. Had some issues with Travis CI and AWS Elastic beanstalk.

Leaving that alone for now and moving on.

Post the afternoon did not make much progress on the back end python testing course. Have completed one test.

Need to check out the wordpress local deployment with the roots ansible. There was some activity on that community.

Like this model fo writing a short blog. Hope I can keep it up.
