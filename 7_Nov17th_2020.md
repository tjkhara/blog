This morning I resumed the cali move stretch and workout. Feeling very down today.

Managed to do some javascript, but just watched the videos and wrote very little code.

Dad said that I should set up his stock trading account. I was initially thinking too much, but maybe i will just set it up.

I am thinking of going back to Brad Schiff's course and redoing the to do project and the first part of the social network project.
