Just started this blog today. I thought it is all I need for now. I really don't need a more complicated solution than this to log what I am doing.

Today working on the pytest woocommerce backend api testing course.

Also working on learning docker. I am beginning to feel a little more comfortable with docker now.

Still need to deploy a project.
