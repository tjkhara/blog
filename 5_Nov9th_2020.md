Writing the blog directly on the website today. Have been using a lot of gists for taking notes for Brad Schiff's course to try and revise the steps.

For the past two or three days that is the course that I've been doing. Today went for Bobby chacha's daughter's wedding lunch. It was a social outing after March. Felt good I think.

Watched two really funny British TV shows the peep show and the in betweeners. Really funny.

Keep getting this weird allergy/cold. Hope that gets better.

Did a video chat with Bhakti and the kids in Dubai. It was her dad's birthday today. Sasha has put on some weight and was looking quite cute. Things have improved in the last two days in terms of energy.

One learning in terms of studying is to take it slow and study deeply. I really began to appreciate Brad Schiff's teaching. It does take a little bit of grit to get started as the mind knows it's going to have to focus, but it is better to do less properly than being all over the place. And, you have to be okay going back and revising concepts. You need to practice that more.
