# Sunday Nov 22nd 2020

Worked on the node course today and have setup local mongodb to work with node and through gui.

Finished the weather app and put it on heroku.

Slept in the afternoon.

Woke up really late in the morning.

Tomorrow have to go to the license place to see about the creta transfer work.

Still quite enjoying the Andrew Mead node course. Really well done course.
