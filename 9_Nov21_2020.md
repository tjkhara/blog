Wordpress hosting thinking:

Sites on digital ocean can be setup very quickly as well. I could just use that.

I was thinking that creating a site and staging site on a shared host would be easier.

Yes digital ocean or even aws lightsail will be up for the job. No need for shared hosting now.

Took a break from the usual course today. Went to the driving range with bhaji. Was a good change.

Good sleep in the afternoon. Feeling rested.

Having conversation with Zaina via voice messages. That seems unintrusive.

Dad is having a lot of anxiety i think and going to the hospital again and again.
