Mostly worked on getting the trellis local environment for wordpress and the remote environment up and running.

Great news that both environments are now set up.

Also got the laravel local container environment up and running through artisan served. That was very cool as well.

Both communities were very helpful. I probably either need to find the flask community or start learning Laravel and or YII2 as PHP frameworks. There still seem to be a lot of requests for wordpress and PHP.
